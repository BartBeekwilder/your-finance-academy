# Personal Finance — project status and hand-over

Read this first on any computer. It says where the project stands, how to
run it, and what's next. Keep it up to date at the end of every session
(Claude: update this file and commit it before finishing).

Last updated: 2026-10-23.

## The product

"Personal Finance" — run your money like a business. Three clients on one
backend:

| Part | Where | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| Website + web app (`/app`) | this repo (`your-finance-academy`), Next.js 16 | `web-app` (not merged to `main`; `main` = live site) |
| iOS / iPadOS app | repo `Personal Finance` (SwiftUI) | `ios-web-parity-oct21` |
| Android | blueprint only: `docs/android-blueprint.md` | — |
| Backend | Supabase project `cjdmrrwsyzpoiemiyyyu` (eu-west-1); schema in `supabase/migrations` 0001–0003 | — |

Decisions:
- Supabase is the ONLY sync (iOS moves off CloudKit, keeps SwiftData as an
  offline cache). RevenueCat for one subscription across App Store, Play
  Store and Stripe.
- Sign-in: Sign in with Apple + email & password + email 6-digit code. NO
  magic links. Demo mode to look around.
- Never push, deploy, or change accounts without asking Bart. Pushing to
  `main` deploys the live site (Vercel). Bart signs in to services himself.

## Running it

Website:
```
npm install
npx next dev -p 3000        # http://localhost:3000/app
npm run test:db             # schema tests (PGlite)
```
`.env.local` (not in git) needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Bart copies them from the Supabase
dashboard. Without them the app runs on demo data. Demo in one tab:
`sessionStorage.setItem('pf-demo','1')`.

iOS (Mac with Xcode only): open `Personal Finance.xcodeproj`. Command-line
build: `xcodebuild -project "Personal Finance.xcodeproj" -scheme "Personal
Finance" -destination generic/platform=iOS -configuration Debug
SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL=-O build`. DEBUG builds seed demo data
(`-seedDemo` / `-removeDemo` launch arguments, ids start with DDDDDDDD).

## Languages (both platforms, 17 languages)

en + nl, de, fr, es, it, pt-BR, pl, tr, ru, ar (RTL), hi, id, ja, ko, vi,
zh-Hans. Every new UI text must be translatable and translated:
- Web: `t("English text", { vars })` from `lib/i18n` (English is the key;
  `tr` alias where `t` is a local variable). Then `node scripts/i18n.mjs
  extract`, add translations to `lib/i18n/messages/<lang>.json`, check with
  `node scripts/i18n.mjs report`.
- iOS: `String(localized:)` / SwiftUI literals → `Localizable.xcstrings`.
  Refresh keys with `xcodebuild -exportLocalizations -project … -localizationPath
  /tmp/pf-loc -exportLanguage nl`, then fill all 16 languages.

## Design rules (Bart's taste)

- Premium, alive UI: everything animates fluidly and physically (springs,
  morphs, zooms), never pops. Live numbers tick for real.
- Brand toggle (`Segmented` / `BrandToggle`) and brand slider for all
  controls; never browser defaults. Dark neon look.
- Loved so far: range zoom on Income vs Spent; budget bars where overspend
  spills out of the bar; the balance sheet ("completely in awe").
- Web and iOS stay at parity: what's built on the web gets ported to iOS.

## Done recently (2026-10-22/23)

- Balance sheet (web + iOS): own posts with month-end values, calculated
  accounts/prepaid/receivable, equity hero, waterfall, draggable tiles,
  dashboard card Compact/Full. Migration 0003 is applied on Supabase.
- Budgets: spill-out bars, Compare/Own budget, Largest first, heat total
  bar, month slider with forecast months, budget pie.
- Edit/delete any transaction; Month/Year switch in page headers; ∑/▮ chart
  switch; stacked-areas option for category charts; savings This year.
- All web changes of 22–23 Oct ported to iOS (builds; not yet run on the
  iPad — it was unavailable).
- Onboarding draft at `/app/welcome` (preview, saves nothing) — waiting for
  Bart's review.
- Website and iOS fully translated into 17 languages.
- Android blueprint: `docs/android-blueprint.md`.

## Next / open

To do (Bart's list):
1. Review the onboarding draft (`/app/welcome`), then auto-open it for new
   accounts and port it to iOS.
2. Real-estate module: home value/WOZ, mortgage parts (annuity/linear, rate,
   term, payment, remaining debt) feeding the balance sheet automatically.
3. Multiple years: add/view earlier years (monthly or year totals), year
   switcher; net worth starting before 1 January.
4. Monthly review / month close: confirm income, check fixed costs, review
   budgets, enter month-end balances, summary, lock the month.
5. Android (after iOS moves to Supabase) — see blueprint §11 for decisions.

Open questions for Bart:
- Dashboard balance card default: Compact or Full?
- Earlier years: monthly totals enough, or import transactions?
- Month close: start automatically on the 1st, or only on demand?
- Android: PWA first? minimum Android version? on-device receipt scanning?

Before going live with the web app: hide the Apple sign-in button until it's
configured, set the Supabase Site URL, merge `web-app` into `main` (with
Bart's OK). Still to do on iOS: replace CloudKit with Supabase sync, align
the dashboard net worth ticker with the net worth model, app icon.
